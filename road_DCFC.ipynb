    "## Road Network-Based EV Charging Station Placement and Supply Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a method for estimating traffic flow on **motorways** and **trunk roads** using OD (Origin-Destination) data and selecting appropriate charging station locations based on intersection points of these roads. The steps followed in this process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traffic Flow Estimation**: Using OD data, we calculate the traffic flow along various road segments, specifically focusing on **motorways** and **trunk roads**. This step ensures we accurately reflect demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging along heavily trafficked routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intersection Identification**: We identify the intersection points of motorways and trunk roads. These intersections represent potential locations where charging stations may be required to meet the demand of electric vehicles traveling through these routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Charging Station Candidate Selection**: Once the intersection points are identified, an algorithm is employed to select appropriate candidate sites for EV charging stations. The algorithm takes into account factors like road connectivity and proximity to major traffic routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Supply Distribution**: The supply of charging capacity is allocated to each station based on the estimated traffic flow in its vicinity. The idea is to ensure that the number of chargers at each location matches the demand generated by the vehicles using that road segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Algorithm Overview**: The station selection and supply allocation follow an optimization approach that seeks to balance demand with the capacity of each station, ensuring an efficient distribution of resources across the road network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides a structured way of placing EV charging stations across a road network, optimizing for the needs of electric vehicles based on real-world traffic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### IDEA: \n",
    "- Travelers traveling between urbans on highways may need to recharge urgently along their route. Therefore, electric vehicle charging stations on highways must be DCFC and located within 50 miles (regulations).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "- **Step1. Traffic Flow Calculation**: Estimating traffic flow based on the OD matrix.\n",
    "- **Step2. Intersection Analysis**: Identifying potential locations for charging stations based on road intersections.\n",
    "- **Step3. Supply Allocation**: Allocating the appropriate number of chargers at each candidate location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections provide detailed code and explanations for each of these steps.\n",
